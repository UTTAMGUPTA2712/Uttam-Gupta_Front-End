# Q1. Explain what the simple List component does.


The List component is a React component that represents a list of items. It uses the SingleListItem component as a memoized sub-component to render each individual item in the list. The ListComponent manages the state for the list, including the selectedIndex state using the useState hook, and handles the click event on items with the handleClick function.

The List component has the following key features:

SingleListItem component:
>This is a memoized sub-component that represents a single item in the list. It receives props such as index, isSelected, onClickHandler, and text from the parent component. These props are used to display the item's text, manage its selected state, and handle click events. The SingleListItem component is memoized using the memo higher-order component (HOC) to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders when the props haven't changed.

ListComponent state management:
>The ListComponent uses the useState hook to manage the selectedIndex state, which keeps track of the index of the currently selected item in the list. The useState hook returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update the state. The selectedIndex state is initialized to null by default.

ListComponent useEffect hook: 
>The ListComponent uses the useEffect hook to reset the selectedIndex state to null whenever the items prop changes. The useEffect hook is used for side effects, such as running code after rendering, and it takes a callback function as its first argument that gets executed when the dependencies provided in the second argument change. In this case, the items prop is provided as a dependency, so whenever the items prop changes, the callback function is executed, resetting the selectedIndex state to null.

ListComponent handleClick function:
>The ListComponent has a handleClick function that takes the index of the clicked item as an argument. When an item is clicked, the handleClick function is called with the index of the clicked item, and it updates the selectedIndex state with the new index value using the setSelectedIndex function, which is the second element returned by the useState hook. This causes a re-render of the ListComponent with the updated selectedIndex state.

Rendering of SingleListItem components:
>The ListComponent maps over the items prop using the map function and renders SingleListItem components for each item in the list. It passes the necessary props such as onClickHandler, text, index, and isSelected to SingleListItem components. The index and text props are passed directly from the items prop, while the onClickHandler is set to the handleClick function of ListComponent and the isSelected prop is set to the selectedIndex state value.

PropTypes: 
>The ListComponent and SingleListItem components use the PropTypes library to define the expected prop types. PropTypes are used to validate that the props passed to the components have the correct data types and are required or not. For example, items prop of ListComponent is defined as an array of objects with a required text prop of string data type. This helps to catch potential prop type errors during development.


# Q2. What problems / warnings are there with code?

- setSelectedIndex is not a function: In the ListComponent, the setSelectedIndex is being used as a function to update the state with the new index value. However, it is defined as an array with destructuring assignment, which may result in an error. To fix this, useState hook should be used correctly, by providing an initial value as the first argument and receiving the state updater function as the second element of the returned array. For example, it should be updated to const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(null);.
- isSelected prop type of SingleListItem: The isSelected prop of the SingleListItem component is defined as PropTypes.bool, which indicates that it should be a boolean value. However, in the ListComponent, it is being passed as isSelected={selectedIndex} which is a numeric value representing the index of the selected item. This may result in unexpected behavior or warning messages. To fix this, the isSelected prop should be passed a boolean value that indicates whether the item is selected or not, for example, isSelected={index === selectedIndex}.
- PropTypes.shapeOf in ListComponent: In the ListComponent, the items prop is defined with PropTypes.array(PropTypes.shapeOf({...})). However, the correct PropTypes syntax for object shape is PropTypes.shape({...}) instead of PropTypes.shapeOf({...}). To fix this, the PropTypes declaration for items prop should be updated to PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({...})) to define an array of objects with the expected shape.
- Missing key prop in SingleListItem component: In the ListComponent, when rendering the SingleListItem components using the map function, a key prop is not provided for each rendered component. The key prop is used by React to efficiently update the DOM and track changes in the list of items. To fix this, a unique key prop should be provided for each rendered SingleListItem component, for example, key={index}.
- Default value for items prop in ListComponent: The ListComponent has a default prop value of null for the items prop. However, based on the PropTypes definition, items prop is expected to be an array of objects. This may result in unexpected behavior if null is passed as the items prop. To fix this, the default prop value for items prop in ListComponent should be an empty array, for example, items: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({...})).isRequired.


# Q3. Please fix, optimize, and/or modify the component as much as you think is necessary.

```ruby
import React, { useState, useEffect, memo } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

const SingleListItem = memo(({ 
    index, 
    isSelected, 
    onClickHandler, 
    text }) => {
  return (
    <li
      style={{ backgroundColor: isSelected ? 'green' : 'red' }}
      onClick={() => onClickHandler(index)}
    >
      {text}
    </li>
  );
});

SingleListItem.propTypes = {
  index: PropTypes.number,
  isSelected: PropTypes.bool,
  onClickHandler: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
};

const List = memo(({ items }) => {
  const [selectedIndex, setSelectedIndex] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    setSelectedIndex(null);
  }, [items]);

  const handleClick = (index) => {
    setSelectedIndex(index);
  };

  return (
    <ul style={{ textAlign: 'left' }}>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <SingleListItem
          key={index}
          onClickHandler={handleClick}
          text={item.text}
          index={index}
          isSelected={index === selectedIndex}
        />
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
});

List.propTypes = {
  items: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.shape({
      text: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
    })
  ).isRequired,
};
List.defaultProps = { 
    items: [
      { text: "Uttam" },
      { text: "12002071" },
      { text: "LPU" },
      { text: "B-Tech" },
      { text: "CSE" },
  
    ],
  };

export default List;
```
